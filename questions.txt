PointCloud currently uses 9 dim input namelz XYZ RGB and normalized location normalized location as to the room (from 0 to 1)

Scannet pointcloud after fusion only XYZ RGB but color not useful i.e. all red.

scene clean / 2 / 2.0 i.e. what use for training of segmentation network the clean ones?

random sample from mesh provided -> what with lables

color lables???? colored by nyu40 labels ply property 'label' denotes the ScanNet label id
    used the ScanNet lable id as the color doesnt match the nyu40 from convert_scannet
