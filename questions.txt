successful able to train pointnet with Scannet and also segment -> voxalize

removed blocks, Batch now into currently 3000 points and feed into network -> but "bad" accuracy because local context lost? 
why actually center? what about scale/roatation invariance

many more classes than original paper

Meeting 1.6.2018


Dataset:
    Scannet: scene clean / 2 / 2.0 i.e. what use for training of segmentation network the clean ones?
        scan_clean2

    Feeding scannet into pointnet:
    color lables???? colored by nyu40 labels, but .ply property 'label' denotes the ScanNet label id -> convert? with what to work
    (used the ScanNet lable id as the color doesnt match the nyu40 from convert_scannet)

    PointNet currently uses 9 dim input namelz XYZ RGB and normalized location normalized location as to the room (from 0 to 1)
    -> how to handle for scannet? rooms etc?

    PointNet: train_data is Batch x Samples from block x 9 -> how to define block and then sample for scannet dataset

scannet training: feed in voxelgrid with each voxel just semantic info? no color etc? tsdf?


train_segmentation      -> train Pointnet
train_reconstruction    -> train LearningPriors: what to use? with output from pointnet

Evaluation:
First step:
    reconstruct.py -> feed pointcloud into segment.py -> get point segmentation -> convert to voxelgrid -> run reconstructtion
Second step:
    reconstruct.py -> feed pointcloud into segment.py -> get point segmentation -> do reconstruction from points???



shift to center: X - X_average



checked what martin meant by signing smth?
