Meeting 1.6.2018


Dataset:
    Scannet: scene clean / 2 / 2.0 i.e. what use for training of segmentation network the clean ones?

    Feeding scannet into pointnet:
    color lables???? colored by nyu40 labels, but .ply property 'label' denotes the ScanNet label id -> convert? with what to work
    (used the ScanNet lable id as the color doesnt match the nyu40 from convert_scannet)

    PointNet currently uses 9 dim input namelz XYZ RGB and normalized location normalized location as to the room (from 0 to 1)
    -> how to handle for scannet? rooms etc?

    PointNet: train_data is Batch x Samples from block x 9 -> samples from block??

scannet training: feed in voxelgrid with each voxel just semantic info? no color etc

blocks for pointnet dataset, samples
